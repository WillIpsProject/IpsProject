    <h2 class="tip-heading tip-1-heading">1. Research Your Destination To Find The Best Photo Opportunties</h2>
    <p class="tip-content tip-1-content">Before your trip, I reccomend researching the destination to find the most interesting photo opportunities. <br> <br> I always research the location I'm traveling to. I do this extensively and obsessively! <br> <br> It's up to you how much research you do. But you should definately spend a bit of time looking up some great places to take pictures. <br> <br> So, what kind of research can you do? <br> <br> First, you could seach for photos that other people have taken at the locations you're planning to visit. <br> <br> Search on Instagram or Google to get an idea of the kinds of photos people take there.</p>
    <h2 class="tip-heading tip-2-heading">2. Capture Your Journey To Tell The Complete Story Of Your Travels</h2>
    <p class="tip-content tip-2-content">Travel photography isn't just about photographing the destination. <br> <br> For a more complete photographic story, capture your hourney to and from the location you're visiting. <br> <br> If you're traveling by plane, try to get a window seat where you have a view of the wing or properller. <br> <br> And of course, you could capture a beautiful aerial view of clouds, mountains, or city lights as you're flying above. Your journey will often involve several different types of transport. And they all offer great photo opportunities. <br> <br> Whether you're traveling by car, taxi, bus, train, boat, or plane, try to capture some interesting photos.</p>
